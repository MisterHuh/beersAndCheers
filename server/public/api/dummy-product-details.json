  "shortDescription": "Dynamic Inertia technology ignites muscles in arms, shoulders, and chest.",
  "longDescription": "Shaking up the way you work out, the Shake Weight is a revolution in strength training. Boasting a legion of devotees who enthusiastically confirm the Shake Weight's claim that it shapes and tones the upper body, this product is hard to ignore.\nThe way it works is this: a special pulsating dumbbell with dynamic inertia technology increases upper body muscle activity by 300 percent compared to traditional weights as you shake the 5-lb weight several different ways. This repetitive shaking stimulates muscle toning and adds shape to your upper arms, chest, and shoulders.\nThe Upper Body Sculpting DVD shows you the proper way to use the Shake Weight so you see the most benefits. It works in only six minutes a day, though if you use it more often, you're likely to see results sooner."
